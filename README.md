# 3D Model Integration with Image-to-3D Asset (Trellis)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate 3D models using **Trellis**, a powerful new tool that allows you to create 3D models from images for free. With the launch of **Trellis**, you can easily generate 3D assets from images, making 3D modeling more accessible and efficient for developers, designers, and creators.
